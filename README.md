# ESP01 Washer Machine simple controller
A simple solution for controlling my washer machine
----------------------------------------------------

This projects satisfies one of my everyday needs: Alerts for when my clothes are done washing. Tired of checking every some minutes to know if my basic washer machine has done the laundry, I created this code, which loaded into an ESP-01 board checks if the door lock has been released and communicates to my IoT server to notify me through an app notification.
